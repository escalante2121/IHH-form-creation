# IHH-form-creation
In House Health Form Project
The purpose of this project is to simply learn and aims to improve our skills in our understanding of HMTL and CSS code, but isn't actually going towards anything
practically in real life, and if we don't finish this, we will still be able to finish the course just fine. So don't stress, let's just get this done so we
can crack on with our canvas work.
